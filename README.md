# Predicting-Racial-Bias-Tendencies-In-Police-Stops

In the final project of my Introduction to Data Science course at the University of Washington, my team of 4 people (including myself) decided to tackle the social issue of racism. We found a large dataset (~8m rows before cleaning) of police stops in the state of Washington ranging all the way back to 2009. By combining this data with the political data (democratic - republican) from each county in Washington we were able to make significant deductions about what type of driver is more likely to be stopped. By conducting analysis in Python and R, we were able to develope powerful visualizations and test meaningful statistical hypotheses we came up with to support our results. Finally, we developed a Machine Learning algorithm to try and predict the race of the driver based on the data from the stop. You can find our project in great detail in the word document and power point presentation.
